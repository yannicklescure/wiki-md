# How to Fix Common Nextcloud Talk Call Issues: Guest Stuck in a Loop or Muted

If a call is failing in **Nextcloud Talk** and guests are experiencing issues such as being stuck in a loop or being muted, it could be caused by a few different factors. Below are some common reasons and troubleshooting steps to identify and resolve the problem:

## 1. TURN Server Misconfiguration

- **Issue**: When making peer-to-peer calls over Nextcloud Talk, if a TURN server isnâ€™t configured or is misconfigured, it can cause issues with establishing a stable connection, resulting in dropped calls or loops.
- **Solution**: Check if the TURN server is correctly set up and reachable from both ends. Verify the TURN server configuration in Nextcloud under `Settings > Talk > Server settings`.

  - The `turnserver` should be running and configured with a reachable public IP or DNS name.
  - Ensure that the **TURN server** has `UDP` ports (usually 3478 or 5349) open on the firewall.
  - If using `coturn`, you can verify its status:

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl status coturn
    ```

- **Testing**: You can use `telnet` or `netcat` to check if the TURN server is reachable:

    ```bash
    nc -zv <TURN_SERVER_IP> 3478
    ```

## 2. STUN/TURN Server Credentials

- **Issue**: Incorrect credentials for the STUN/TURN server can result in connection issues. This could cause participants to be unable to join or result in a call loop.
- **Solution**: Verify the credentials (`username` and `password`) in the Nextcloud Talk settings. Also, ensure that the credentials match what is configured on the TURN server.

## 3. Firewall and Network Configuration

- **Issue**: Network or firewall restrictions might be blocking communication between the TURN server and participants, causing calls to loop or fail.
- **Solution**: Check the firewall rules on the Nextcloud server, the TURN server, and any network devices in between. Ensure that ports such as `3478` (TURN), `5349` (TURN over TLS), and `443` (HTTPS) are open.

## 4. Incorrect Permissions

- **Issue**: If the user permissions are misconfigured, guests might be muted or unable to participate properly.
- **Solution**: Go to `Talk settings` in Nextcloud and ensure that the permissions for guests are set correctly (e.g., allow microphone and camera use).

## 5. Browser Compatibility Issues

- **Issue**: Some browsers might have limited support for WebRTC or might not handle video/audio streams properly.
- **Solution**: Make sure all participants are using the latest version of a supported browser like **Chrome, Firefox**, or **Safari**. You can also try switching browsers to see if the issue persists.

## 6. Missing or Outdated TURN Server Software

- **Issue**: If the TURN server software is not installed, outdated, or misconfigured, it can lead to calls not connecting or audio issues.
- **Solution**: For `coturn`, ensure it is installed and up-to-date:

    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install coturn
    ```

  Configure `coturn` by editing `/etc/turnserver.conf` and specifying the following settings:

    ```text
    listening-port=3478
    fingerprint
    lt-cred-mech
    use-auth-secret
    static-auth-secret=YOUR_SECRET
    realm=YOUR_DOMAIN
    external-ip=YOUR_SERVER_IP
    ```

## 7. SSL/TLS Certificate Issues

- **Issue**: If your TURN server uses TLS (ports `5349` and `443`), expired or invalid SSL certificates can prevent successful communication.
- **Solution**: Ensure that the certificates are valid and correctly configured. Test SSL/TLS connectivity using:

    ```bash
    openssl s_client -connect <TURN_SERVER_IP>:5349
    ```

## 8. Nextcloud Version and Talk App Compatibility

- **Issue**: Incompatible versions of Nextcloud and the Talk app can cause issues with WebRTC calls.
- **Solution**: Make sure both the Nextcloud server and the Talk app are up to date. Check compatibility in the [Nextcloud app store](https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/spreed).

## Next Steps

1. **Test your TURN server** by setting up a test environment or using third-party tools like [Trickle ICE](https://webrtc.github.io/samples/src/content/peerconnection/trickle-ice/) to verify the connectivity.
2. **Collect logs** from both Nextcloud and the TURN server (`/var/log/turnserver.log` for `coturn`).
3. **Share the logs here** if you need more help analyzing the issue.
